# Image Setup Instructions

## Hero/Founder Photo Setup

1. **Save your photo as**: `/public/founder.jpg`
   - The photo you provided (person in plaid shirt at yellow table) should be saved here
   - Recommended dimensions: 800x800px minimum for quality
   - Format: JPG for photos, PNG if you need transparency

2. **Update the Hero component** (`/src/components/Hero.tsx`):
   - The photo will automatically display once placed in `/public/founder.jpg`
   - The component is already configured to use Next.js Image optimization

3. **Image optimization tips**:
   - Crop to square aspect ratio if needed (1:1)
   - Compress using tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh
   - Target file size: under 200KB for web performance

4. **Alternative professional shots**:
   - Consider having 2-3 professional photos ready
   - One for hero section (current photo works great)
   - One for About page (can be same or different angle)
   - One for footer/contact (optional)

The photo shows exactly the right professional-yet-approachable vibe for Japanese B2B clients!
